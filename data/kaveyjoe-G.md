To reduce gas consumption consider the following optimizations:



Inline Constants: Instead of using variables for constants like staderConfig, nextRequestIdToFinalize, nextRequestId, finalizationBatchLimit, and maxNonRedeemedUserRequestCount, you can directly replace their occurrences with their actual values. This reduces the overhead of accessing storage variables.

Use Storage Variables Efficiently: Consider using local variables instead of storage variables where possible. For example, in the finalizeUserWithdrawalRequest function, you can use local variables for lockedEthXToBurn and ethToSendToFinalizeRequest instead of modifying storage variables directly.

Avoid Unnecessary Reverts: Review the conditions that trigger reverts and ensure they are necessary. Unnecessary reverts consume gas. For example, in the requestWithdraw function, there are several revert statements that could be consolidated into a single check.

Use view and pure Functions: Identify functions that don't modify state and update their visibility to view or pure where appropriate. This optimization allows these functions to be executed without consuming gas.

Use transfer Instead of call: In the sendValue function, replace the low-level call with transfer to send Ether. The transfer method automatically handles failures and reverts if the transfer fails, saving gas compared to using call.

Reduce Storage Access: Minimize storage reads and writes, as they consume gas. For example, in the finalizeUserWithdrawalRequest function, you can store staderConfig.getStakePoolManager() in a local variable to avoid repeated storage access.

Use Modifiers: Consider using modifiers for common access control checks or validation checks. Modifiers can help reduce code duplication and make the contract more readable.

Optimize Loops: Review loops and ensure they are as efficient as possible. Avoid unnecessary iterations and expensive operations within loops.

Optimize loop variables and conditions: In the poolAllocationForExcessETHDeposit function, you can optimize the loop by moving the j variable outside the loop. Additionally, you can simplify the condition inside the loop by using selectedValidatorCount >= poolAllocationMaxSize instead of performing two separate checks.

Minimize storage writes: Reduce unnecessary storage writes by assigning values to variables only when needed. For example, in the poolAllocationForExcessETHDeposit function, you can move the assignment of i = (i + 1) % poolCount outside the loop, as it's only used once the loop ends.

Reorder function modifiers: In the initialize function, you can reorder the function modifiers for better readability and consistency.

Remove unused variables: The poolIdArray variable in the poolAllocationForExcessETHDeposit function is declared but never used. You can remove it to avoid unnecessary gas costs.
