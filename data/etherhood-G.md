- In code at https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-stader/blob/main/contracts/UserWithdrawalManager.sol#L124 ```staderConfig.getStakePoolManager()``` is being called again after calling same function and checking if vault is healthy, this line can be bumped before that check, ```poolManager``` being used in check statement directly will save gas cost for calling same function again ~ 1300 gas
- At https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-stader/blob/main/contracts/UserWithdrawalManager.sol#L145, ```totalEthRequestedForWithdraw``` can be calculated and summed in loop and then subtracted at end of loop, rather than writing to storage during each iteration, it would (n-1)*100 gas
- https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-stader/blob/main/contracts/StaderStakePoolsManager.sol#L241 can be moved out of loop, and if any deposit is made can be updated, will save (poolCount - 1)*100 gas
- In function https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-stader/blob/main/contracts/SocializingPool.sol#L61, ```totalOperatorETHRewardsRemaining,totalOperatorSDRewardsRemaining``` is being read 3 times from storage and then incremented, which can instead be cached and then post update stored in storage variables, would save 400 gas. 
- Similarly ```staderConfig``` is being read from storage for more than 2 times at a lot functions across different files, where it can be cached in memory and used instead of reading repeatedly from storage, would save lot of gas. Eg. https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-stader/blob/main/contracts/SocializingPool.sol#L61, https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-stader/blob/main/contracts/PoolSelector.sol#L76, etc
- Cache ```INodeRegistry((staderConfig).getPermissionlessNodeRegistry()).POOL_ID()``` in memory or storage during initialization instead of calling each time in loop in https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-stader/blob/main/contracts/PermissionlessPool.sol#L96
- In https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-stader/blob/main/contracts/PermissionlessNodeRegistry.sol#L228  getPreDepositSize should be called and cached and passed in ```handleInvalidSignature``` function, where instead it is being called for each key in loop costing 3k gas in each call
