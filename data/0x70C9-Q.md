## NodeRegistry's markValidatorReadyToDeposit functions execute successfully with all empty arrays
Both `PermissionedNodeRegistry.markValidatorReadyToDeposit` and `PermissionlessNodeRegistry.markValidatorReadyToDeposit` run successfully if the provided arrays are all empty. Consider adding a length check similar to the one in `checkInputKeysCountAndCollateral` to avoid bad UX.

## PermissionedPool.stakeUserETHToBeaconChain will succeed and emit IncreasedTotalActiveValidatorCount even when requiredValidators is 0
Because `stakeUserETHToBeaconChain` is only called by the pool manager, which will never call with value 0, msg.value will be bigger than 0. However, if msg.value turns out to be less than `getStakedEthPerNode`, the variable `requiredValidators` will be 0. This will create an empty `selectedOperatorCapacity` array, and `increaseTotalActiveValidatorCount` will emit the event `IncreasedTotalActiveValidatorCount`, even though the `totalActiveValidatorCount` didnÂ´t change. Consider adding a check for this case in `stakeUserETHToBeaconChain`, or only emitting an event if the validator count actually changes (i.e. `_count > 0`).
