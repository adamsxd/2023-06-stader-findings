# Gas Optimizations

## NodeELRewardVault.withdraw could query the right slots and avoid external calls
In the `withdraw` function, one queries poolId, operatorId, etc, by doing `IVaultProxy(address(this)).poolId()`, etc.  Consider just mimicking the same storage layout present in the VaultProxy contract and just query those values as normal SLOADs, thus avoiding external calls to self.

## PermissionedPool.stakeUserETHToBeacon for loop `index` can be incremented with unchecked
The for loop inside another for loop in `stakeUserETHToBeacon` is incrementing `index` without an unchecked block. Consider wrapping it into an unchecked block, just like itÂ´s being done with `i`.

## PermissionedPool.fullDepositOnBeaconChain doesn't need to call getPermissionedNodeRegistry
The `fullDepositOnBeaconChain` function can only be called by the PermissionedNodeRegistry. So after the first UtilLib check, we are certain that `msg.sender` is the node registry address. So instead of doing `address nodeRegistryAddress = staderConfig.getPermissionedNodeRegistry();`, just do `address nodeRegistryAddress = msg.sender;`.

## Make `PermissionedPool.computeDepositDataRoot` public instead of external
The `computeDepositDataRoot` function gets called internally inside the PermissionedPool contract, and since it is external it can only be called through an external call. Consider changing the visibility to `public` to allow the execution of `computeDepositDataRoot` inside the contract without the need for an external call.
